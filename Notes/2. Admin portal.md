# Setting Up the Admin Panel

In the terminal:

```python
python manage.py createsuperuser # then follow the instruction
```

To change password of existing admin do:

```python
python manage.py changepassword admin
```

Some Admin panel customisations can be done. Some of them are shown in the `urls.py` file of `store`.

## Registering Models

- To view the models in the Admin Panel we need to register them in the admin application.

- For doing that and the doing the desired customisation to the Application we need to use the `admin.py` file present in every application created in Django.

  - For registering a collection in the admin panel, the `admin.py` file of the application write:
    `admin.site.resgister(ModelName)`

# Customising the Admin Panel

## Ordering and Renaming of column details

- To change the name shown in the Admin panel do the following in the `model` defination:
  ```python
  def __str__(self) -> str:
      return self.Title
  ```

## Customising the List Page

- Define a class `ProductAdmin` in `admin.py` of the application as following:

  ```python
  class ProductAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
      list_display = ['title', 'price']
  # Register the class as
  admin.site.register(models.Product, ProductAdmin)
  ```

  Alternatively

  ```python
  @admin.register(models.Product)
  class ProductAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
      list_display = ['title', 'price']
      list_editable = ['price']
      list_per_page = 10
  ```

## Adding a computed column in the Admin Portal

- Refer `Inventorty Status` column in `admin.py` in `shop`.

- For preloading data in admin panel like we did in `select_related`, here pass a parameter `list_select_related = [. . .]`

## Overriding the Basic Query Set

Sometime we need to override the existing Basic Query Set. Refer to `CollectionAdmin` in `admin.py` in `shop`.

## Providing links to other Pages

- For providing links to other pages we first need to import an utility function `format_html`.
- Now the links inside the Django application might change over time, so to ensure that, we will also import `reverse` from `django.urls`.

  ```python
  from django.utils.html import format_html, urlencode
  from django.urls import reverse

  @admin.register(models.Collection)
  class CollectionAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
      list_display = ['title', 'product_count']
      # but product_count is not a defined feild inside collection, so we need to define that as well
      @admin.display(ordering = 'product_count')
      def product_count(self,collection):
          url = reverse('admin: shop_product_changelist') # format = admin: AppName_ModelName_Page

          # For querying the specific products of a collection we need to add a filter
          # url += '?collection__id='+str(collection.id) # The hard-coded version of the filter

          # The dynamic implementation
          url += '?'+ urlencode({
            'collection__id': str(collection.id)
          })

          link = format_html('<a href{} = >{}</a>', url,collection.product_count ) # Inside the {}
          # url and collection.product_count will be displayed inorder (whatever is ther after comma)
          return link
          # but product_count is not defined inside collection, so we need to define that as well
      def get_queryset(self, request):
          # return super().get_queryset(request) # This is the default implementation
          # Over-writing it
          return super().get_queryset(request).annotate(
              product_count = Count('product')
          )
  ```

## Adding Search to List Page

Use the key word `search_fields` while defining the admin panel info. Refer `CustomerAdmin` in `admin.py` in `shop`.

## Adding Filters to List Page

Use the key word `list_filters` while defining the admin panel info. Refer `ProductAdmin` in `admin.py` in `shop`.

To define custom filters, we follow the following steps:

- Define a class of any name that extend `admin.SimpleListFilter`
- Inside this class define the attributes:
  - `title`
  - `parameter_name`
    And the following methods:
  - `queryset`
  - `lookups`
    Refer `InventoryFilter` class in `admin.py` in `shop`.

## Defining Custom Actions

Action button are present in the dropdown menu options beside it. Refer `clear_inventory` in `ProductAdmin` in `admin.py` in `shop`.

Use the key word `actions` while defining the admin panel info. Refer `ProductAdmin` in `admin.py` in `shop`, then define the action. Refer `clear_inventory` in `ProductAdmin` in `admin.py` in `shop`.

- To show different type of messages like success, warning, etc. import `messages` from `django.contrib`, and pass a third argument in `message_user`

## Customising Forms

To custimising the add/edit form we can follow the steps below:

- To limit the input fields use the key word `fields` while defining the admin panel info. Fields writen in `fields = ['....']` are included in the form.

- To limit the input fields we can also use the key word `exclude` while defining the admin panel info. Fields writen in `exclude = ['....']` are excluded from all the available fields in the form.

- To make the input fields non-editable and read-only we use the key word `readonly_fields = ['....']` while defining the admin panel info.

- To prepopulate fields we can write as:
  ```python
    prepopulated_fields = {
        'slug': ['title', 'price']
    }
  ```
- To make an autocomplete field use the key word `autocomplete_fields = ['....']` while defining the admin panel info. But we have to add this field in `search_fields` in the admin Panel accordingly.

## Adding Data Validations

- There is some basic validation already present in Django Admin panel.

> If you make a model field as `null = True` then the change is only in the DB, to make it optional in the admin panel, do `blank = True`.

- To make custom validation we import Validators from django by `from django.core.validators import MinValueValidator`. For more validators google `Django Validators`.

An Example for validating a minimum value is :

```python
from django.core.validators import MinValueValidator

class Product(models.Model):
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2,
        validators=[MinValueValidator(1)]) # The min Value should be greater than or equal to 1
```

## Editing Children using Inlines

To insert a tabular inline function, see the following code (inside `shop` in `admin.py`):

- `TabularInline`

```python
# Inline defination
class OrderItemsInline(admin.TabularInline): # This is of the form of a small Table
    # This inherently, contains all fileds of ModelAdmin
    autocomplete_fields = ['product']
    model = models.OrderItems
    # By default the number of extra entries is 3
    # To increase that do:
    extra = 4


# Registering the Orders column in Admin Portal
@admin.register(models.Order)
class OrderAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    autocomplete_fields = ['customer']
    list_select_related = ['customer']
    inlines = [OrderItemsInline]
    list_display = ['id', 'customer_name','placed_at','payment_status' ]
    ordering = ['placed_at']

    # To use autocomplete you might have to add some search fields accordingly
```

- Use `admin.StackedInline` for getting a Standard Django form.
