# Setting Up the Admin Panel

In the terminal:

```python
python manage.py createsuperuser # then follow the instruction
```

To change password of existing admin do:

```python
python manage.py changepassword admin
```

Some Admin panel customisations can be done. Some of them are shown in the `urls.py` file of `store`.

## Registering Models

- To view the models in the Admin Panel we need to register them in the admin application.

- For doing that and the doing the desired customisation to the Application we need to use the `admin.py` file present in every application created in Django.

  - For registering a collection in the admin panel, the `admin.py` file of the application write:
    `admin.site.resgister(ModelName)`

# Customising the Admin Panel

## Ordering and Renaming of column details

- To change the name shown in the Admin panel do the following in the `model` defination:
  ```python
  def __str__(self) -> str:
      return self.Title
  ```

## Customising the List Page

- Define a class `ProductAdmin` in `admin.py` of the application as following:

  ```python
  class ProductAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
      list_display = ['title', 'price']
  # Register the class as
  admin.site.register(models.Product, ProductAdmin)
  ```

  Alternatively

  ```python
  @admin.register(models.Product)
  class ProductAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
      list_display = ['title', 'price']
      list_editable = ['price']
      list_per_page = 10
  ```
